I'm currently a 2nd year undergraduate pursuing my B.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the American University of Beirut.

I am an enthusiastic and driven individual wanting to explore both the technical and business side of the industry. I have a strong interest in finance and machine learning, and welcome the opportunity to express my passion and problem solving skills in a variety of fields such as medicine, genetics, cybersecurity and financial engineering. 
I am particularly interested in the applications of ML to Biology. To this end, I have started research on building a Convolutional Neural Network to try and automatically determine the ejection fraction of the heart from MRI images. This is based off the [Second Annual Data Science Bowl](http://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl) which was hosted by Kaggle in early 2016. I believe progress in Medicine can be greatly accelerated by its interaction with Machine Learning and am truly inspired to try and contribute.

I am currently at Columbia University for the summer, taking a Machine Learning (COMS 4771) and Convex Optimization (MATH 2500) class. I am getting to learn R through the amazing [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) which is a great addition to my C++ and Python background. I'm also learning loads of Latex as a byproduct of doing homeworks. 

My future goals include getting comfortable with Deep and Reinforced Learning and their applications to visual recognition. To that end, I intend to study Michael Nielsen's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) and Stanford's [CS 231n: CNN for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/).

In my free time, I like to blog, [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/kevin_zakka) and take pictures. I'm also a huge fan of tennis, play badminton and enjoy honing my classical guitar skills.
