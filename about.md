I'm currently a junior undergraduate researcher pursuing my B.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the American University of Beirut.

My general approach in life is to understand things *clearly* and *elegantly*. Some of my topics of interest include Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Biology. I believe progress in Medicine can be greatly accelerated by its interaction with Machine Learning and am truly inspired to try and contribute.

I enjoy swimming and blogging in my free time. 

Feel free to check out some of my work on [Github](https://github.com/kevinzakka).
